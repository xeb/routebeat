== Overview

Pingbeat is a simple, lighweight utility to ping a list of target
hosts and write the results to Elasticsearch or another output
supported by elastic/libbeat. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 and can send ICMP (raw
socket) or UDP pings.  It uses the tatsushid/go-fastping library to
bulk send pings to targets.

You can configure an interval on which to ping targets, whether to
send ICMP or UDP pings and optionally choose IPv4 or IPv6
support. Pingbeat will resolve hostnames using the system's resolver,
looking up and adding all DNS A/AAAA records for a given hostname as target
IP addresses to send ping packets to.
