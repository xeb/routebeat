############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:

  ### Elasticsearch as output
  elasticsearch:

    # Array of hosts to connect to.
    # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
    # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
    # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
    hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

    # Optional index name. The default is "pingbeat" and generates
    # [pingbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD keys.
    #index: "pingbeat"

    # Optional HTTP Path
    #path: "/elasticsearch"

    # The number of times a particular Elasticsearch index operation is attempted. If
    # the indexing operation doesn't succeed after this many retries, the events are
    # dropped. The default is 3.
